/*
GraphQL queries here are used to generate Go code and placed in `generated.go`.
`genqlient.yaml` identifies that these are the files to process and where the resulting Go code should go.
`schema.graphql` is generated from Mythic Scripting (can be done via Jupyter container) and function to generate this is identified in Mythic's changelog docs.
`go run github.com/Khan/genqlient` will re-generate this data
